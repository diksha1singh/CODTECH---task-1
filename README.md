Introduction
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers, with 5 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species (the type of iris flower). This project aims to perform a thorough EDA to understand the characteristics of the dataset and visualize the relationships between the features.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
pandas
NumPy
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

*Usage*
To perform EDA on the Iris dataset, you can run the provided Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes all the necessary steps to load, explore, and visualize the dataset.
